"User Stories" to be migrated from C:\NMS to the NMS app module within ems-platform project:

-Pl see project foldder C:\NMS, review all front end, back end, config files.
-Claude has already developed following user stories in above files. Pl review these user stories and transfer all these features in our NMS module within our C:\Dev\ems-platform project.
-Pl keep all existing features, configurations of ems-platform unchanged. 
-Pl keep "Security features' recently added to ems-platform unchanged.
-Pl see all the relevant named screenshots in C:\Pictures\screenshots.
-Aim is to consolidate all the features from C:\NMS into NMS app module within our project C:\ems-platform.
-See the "User stories" list below:
-Role Based Access Control System (RBAC). Two roles: User and Admin.
-Password Control Mechanism, minimum 8 digits alpha numeric password, automatic session logout after in-action for 30 mins
-"CANARIS Logo" on all key dashboards
-Additional Widgets/Pages/dashboards with content details as follows:
-Masters:Customer Master, customer hierarchy HO & Branches, Page to Add Nodes with device details like OEM make, model, IP address, whether critical or normal, protocol, polling intervals, customer and branch location, Page for Auto Discovery for physical, logical,wired & wireless Networks. Define KPIs (Key Performance Indicators : System Availability/ down time, Network Bandwidth/ Traffic, Network Speed/ Performance, CPU, Memory, Disc Usage, Latency, Packet Loss, Jitters, Ping and HTTP Availability, QoS and VoIP, Page for Configuration Management for creating templates for different configs,Option to push configs across the select networks through CLI, Take scheduled back-ups, Page to set alarm thresholds for all critical telemetry parameters.
-Provision for bulk node import through csv, excel file.
